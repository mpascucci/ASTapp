# Image acquisition protocol for AST analysis #

## Introduction ##
This document guides you to acquire good quality AST (Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) images with a smartphone or a tablet.

## Examples ##

Here you can find some sexamples of good and bad pictures of AST images.
The first lines displays good quality pictures. The other images illustrates common mistakes.

## Protocol ##

This protocole guides you to take standardised ATB (antibiogramme) images, which have the appropriate quality for further analysis.

### Materials ###

- A smartphone (or tablet) with camera (resolution ≥ 12 megapixels)
- A rectangular piece of matt black felt, which has the size of an A4 (21x30 cm) or larger.
- A rigid sheet of matt black cardboard, which has the size of an A3 (42 x 60 cm)  or larger.
- 2 objects that can be used ad stand for the cardboard (see fig 1). Their height should be around 16 cm.

|-----------------------------------:|

|                           figure 1 |



### Setup ###

Choose a bright environment to install the image acquisition setup.
Light should be uniform and diffuse. The light sources (windows, lamps) should not be too close to the AST.
It is not advisable to use a table lamp.

Put the piece of black felt (A4) on a flat surface (for example a lab bench) and put the two stands, one on each side of the felt (see fig. 1).

|                                 |
|--------------------------------:|
| ![](images/protocol_setup.jpg) |
|                        figure 2 |



Make a small hole in the very center of the black cardboard (A3) which is large enough for your smartphone’s camera.
Put the cardboard on top of the two stands (see fig. 2)
- On your smartphone, open the camera application and do the following setup:
	1. deactivate the flash light.
	2. set the countdown timer to 5 seconds.
	3. select the program to AUTO
	4. select the largest size (maximum megapixels) and the highest quality (100%). 
	

| Mode selection                  | Camera Settings                        |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ![](images/Screenshot_AUTO.png) | ![](images/Screenshot_SizeQuality.png) |
|                                 | figure 3                               |


Put your mobile on the cardboard (screen upside) and center the camera in the hole. Your pictures will be taken through the hole.

Take and AST and remove the plastic top cover. With the camera application open and running, so that you can see the image on your smartphone’s screen,  put the AST on the black felt.

Make sure that the picture background is all black and that the AST is entirely in the picture. The AST should be as large as possible in the picture, with just a small black border around.


|                                      |
|-------------------------------------:|
| ![](images/protocol_setup_final.jpg) |
|                             figure 4 |


At this point you might decide to adjust the picture by changing the distance between the camera and the AST.  In order to do this tou can change your cardboard stands or to put something (like a book) under the felt.

### Ready to take the picture ###

Look at the image on on your smartphone and compare it with the examples at the beginning of this document.
Check that:
- the AST is not out of frame
- the antibiotic labels are on focus (not blurred)
- there are no shadows or light reflection on the AST

### Take the picture ###

Take the picture and check the quality. Zoom on the labels to make sure that they are not blurred. 
Optimize the setup until you are satisfied with the picture quality.
By following this protocol you should be able to take pictures of the same quality of figure XXX.

After taking a picture, make sure that all the following conditions are satisfied:
   - The AST is entirely in the picture and does not touch the image borders
   - If the AST is square, its border should be parallel to the image borders
   - There is no strong perspective distortion.
